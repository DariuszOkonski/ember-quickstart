    I love the idesa! I'm really excited about where this yrar's EmberConf is
    going, I'm sure it's going to be the best one yet. Some quick notes
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Definitely agree that we should double the coffe budget this year (it
      really is impressive how much we go through!)
    </li>
    <li>
      A blimp would definitely make the venue very easy to find, but I think it
      might be a bit out of our budget. Maybe we could rent some spotlights
      instead?
    </li>
    <li>
      We absolutely will need more hamster wheels, last year's line was
      <em>way</em>
      too long. Will get on that now before rental season hits its peak.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let me know when you've nailed down the dates!</p>
